This interactive dashboard explores the connection between coffee consumption, stress levels, sleep quality, BMI, and health indicators across various nations. The goal of the dashboard is to deliver a clear understanding of how lifestyle choices affect stress and overall health through data-driven visual insights. 

The dashboard emphasizes essential metrics, including 9.61% of respondents facing high stress levels, 0.17% indicating serious health concerns, an average coffee consumption of 2.51 cups daily, and an average sleep time of 6.64 hours. These indicators provide a brief overview of the general health and lifestyle trends identified in the dataset.

Users can interact with the dashboard through country and gender-based filters, allowing for flexible exploration of the data. It visualizes the relationship between coffee intake and sleep hours, demonstrates how increasing coffee consumption impacts stress levels, presents sleep quality distribution across different countries, and compares average BMI across various occupations.

The analysis shows that people who drink more coffee tend to have higher stress and less sleep. It also finds that BMI varies between different jobs. In general, the results suggest that balanced habits, like drinking coffee in moderation and getting enough sleep, help improve sleep quality and well-being.

This project was built using Tableau, focusing on interactive data visualization, analytical KPIs, and clear storytelling through dashboards. It is intended for recruiters, analysts, and stakeholders interested in understanding lifestyle and health trends through data.
